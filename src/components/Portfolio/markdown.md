## 3D GLSL Advanced Shader Effects

This was an assignment completed at the University of Hull during the second semester of my second year of study. It was undertaken in the same module as [this 3D OpenGL Scene with Shaders](https://samsmithdev.wordpress.com/portfolio/3d-opengl-scene-with-shaders/). The aim was to produce advanced effects using shaders written in GLSL. The effects were implemented inside of RenderMonkey, a piece of software that allows a developer to quickly prototype shader effects by handling all of the OpenGL binding code, model loading, etc for you.

I will list the effects implemented with pictures, but for a detailed description of each effect and how i implemented them, please read this [short report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NhITXHD2zVZ9iKmbysgIPEPOZxyHIDIp/view).

Vertex Scaling/Manipulation: Implemented in most effects to achieve model position, size, shape.
